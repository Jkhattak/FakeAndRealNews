# Fake vs Real News Detection using Machine Learning
This is a machine learning project that aims to classify news articles into two categories - real and fake. With the proliferation of online news and social media, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake news, which can have serious consequences on public opinion and decision-making.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of news articles labeled as either real or fake. The dataset contains a total of 38729 articles, with 21417 articles labeled as real and 23481 articles labeled as fake. The dataset is obtained from kaggle.

# Approach
The approach taken to classify news articles into real and fake categories involves building a machine learning model using natural language processing techniques. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and is then used to classify new, unseen articles as real or fake.

<li> The following steps were taken in the development of the machine learning model:

<li> Data Preprocessing: The raw text data was cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized to prepare it for input into the machine learning model.

<li> Feature Extraction: The textual data was transformed into numerical feature vectors using techniques such as Bag of Words and Word2Vec.

<li> Model Training: 

<li> Model Evaluation: 

<li> Model Deployment: The trained machine learning model was deployed as a web application, allowing users to input new news articles and obtain predictions on whether they are real or fake.
